// Get the mean of an array 8kyu
/* It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

The array will never be empty. */

// Another solution:

function getAverage(marks){

    // calculates total number of marks
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < marks.length; i++){
      total += marks[i];
    }
    
    /* returns total number of marks divided by number of marks
       rounded down to nearest integer */
