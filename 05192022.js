// Returning Strings 8kyu
// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

function greet(name){
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
  }

  
// Another solution:

const greet = name => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
